Liquidation of a company is not the sole agenda of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code,” Ms. Sitharaman said.\r\n\r\nWith the passing of the bill, as many as seven sections of the Code stand amended. Under the Code, a financial creditor may file an application before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for initiating the insolvency resolution process. The NCLT must find the existence of default within 14 days. Thereafter, a Committee of Creditors (CoC), consisting of financial creditors, will be constituted for taking decisions regarding insolvency resolution. The CoC may either decide to restructure the debtor’s debt by preparing a resolution plan or liquidate the debtor’s assets.",
